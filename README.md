# Domoticz Dz_Event Enphase Envoy
Domoticz/Dz_Event/Enphase Envoy FW
This repo is a litle personal reminder to grab data from MINE microinverter gateway.
Enphase treat user as animal.
Enphase sends production and consumption data to amazon's AWS IoT servers using the
mqtt service without my explicit consent, so I decided to isolate the inverter from
the network and manage production and consumption data locally in order to optimize
consumption through home automation.
With their recent latest firmware update, version D7, obviously carried out remotely
without being notified and therefore modifying, as things stand, what was bought
about a year ago without my approval. As for me, as if they came to your house and
changed the color of a car door without telling you ninete, in my opinion it is a 
blatant modification of the characteristics of the object I had purchased.
Probably because of the ease of remote access to the system have at their
sole discretion MODIFIED sil my object to ensure security. I proceeded to isolate
the gateway of my microinverters through firewalls and with a scrip DzEvent I again 
reuperare the data, asking their servers, every minute the necessary token. Do I 
generate traffic injecting their servers? Problems them, mosquitoes we should all 
do in order to re-enable local access without too much and make sure that it is the 
local user to ask for update and not and is done remotely in a sibylline way, 
modifying in fact what we had purchased.
